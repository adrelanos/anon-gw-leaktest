.SH "NAME"
\fBleaktest\fR \- start looking for leaks
.P
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
leaktest
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Anonymity Distribution Gateway specific leaktest\.
.P
Advanced users, developers and auditors only!
.P
First configures tshark, then comments in \fBReachableDirAddresses *:80\fR, \fBReachableORAddresses *:443\fR and \fBFascistFirewall 1\fR in /usr/share/tor/tor\-service\-defaults\-torrc, reloads Tor, checks Tor\'s status, and finally runs tshark and waits until you abort using \fBCTRL + C\fR\. After aborting it resets /usr/share/tor/tor\-service\-defaults\-torrc back to normal (comments out \fBReachableDirAddresses *:80\fR, \fBReachableORAddresses *:443\fR and \fBFascistFirewall 1\fR) and reloads Tor and checks its status again\. See /usr/bin/leaktest for implementation details\.
.P
As long as it\'s running, it writes tshark\'s output to standard output\.
.P
The tester is supposed to run \fBleaktest\fR on Workstation after leaktest has been started on Gateway\.
.P
There are other leak tests as well, please refer to the Whonix online documentation\.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Return codes do not implicate the existence or absence of leaks! Returns 0, if no script error has been caught, otherwise returns 1\. Please report a bug in case you catch return value 1\.
.SH "HOW TO INTERPRET THE RESULT"
It requires a background on basic networking, which is unfortunately outside the scope of this man page and Whonix documentation\. Whonix online documentation pages LeakTests and LeakTestsOld contain hints for interpretation and other leak tests\.
